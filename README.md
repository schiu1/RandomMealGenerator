# RandomMealGenerator
- Heavy on JavaScript usage.
- Uses TheMealDB API to get a random meal and a recipe for it as a JSON object.
- Sends a API request with the fetch method. The JSON object has its information extracted and displayed in HTML.
- Can press the Get Recipe! button again to load a new random recipe.

This App and helped me with:
- Learning how to submit API requests with fetch().
- Learning/Refreshing knowledge on parsing JSON objects.
- Learning how to embed a YouTube video into HTML page.
- Learning more CSS styling.
